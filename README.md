Teja's personal space invaders pygame game

### About the game
I created the game just to learn the basics of OOP, Functional programming, etc...

### To Run
1.  Download and install python 3.3 or above.
2. Pip install pygame
3. etc...

### Rules
If your run the home_page.py -> Guide it should give you some key bindings. 
The main ones you need for running template.py is using the number keys to change weapons
